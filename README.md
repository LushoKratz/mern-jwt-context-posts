## MERN-JWT-Context Posts Web Application

In this MERN project, im using express framework to create the backend with JWT controllers and routes
Also i used React library, Hooks like useContext,etc, and npm modules to create frontend.

### Considerations

* DataBase: You need to put your MongoDb or MongoDbAtlas URI in the database.js file in backend directory.
* Backend: You also need to create a .env file in backend directory with enviroment var called PORT and the value in number.
* Frontend: Then you need to create a .env file in frontend directory with an envirotment var called REACT_APP_BACKEND_URI with the URI of the backend.

## In frontend im using the next NPM modules and libraries.

* Bootstrap

* React Hook Form

## React Hooks Used:

* useState
* useEffect
* useHookForm
* useContext
